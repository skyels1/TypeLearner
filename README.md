this is the first program I have made using C

## Plans for the future of this project

- I hope to eventually have a long list of practicing sentences to test on so that the content doesnt go dry

- possibly add randomizer to it so that its just random letters and such for more practice

- most importantly I plan to add code examples to this to practice typing real code instead of just sentences ie more practical for my usage

## Status

This project is a work in progress and is far from completion
