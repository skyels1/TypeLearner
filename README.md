## About

this project was meant to help me (and posibly others) learn how to type home row at a acceptable speed

this is the first program I have made using C

- medium (long sentences with not puntuation or capitals)
- hard (sentences with capitals and punctuation)

and has words per minute calculator (WPM) and accuracy percentage

## Plans for the future of this project

- [x] I hope to eventually have a long list of practicing sentences to test on so that the content doesnt go dry

- [ ] possibly add randomizer to it so that its just random letters and such for more practice

- [ ] most importantly I plan to add code examples to this to practice typing real code instead of just sentences ie more practical for my usage

## Status

This project is a work in progress and is far from completion.\
steady progress is made, though unoptimal there is still a lot of progress.
